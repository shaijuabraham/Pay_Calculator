The project involves designing a Windows Form application using Visual Studio. It includes renaming the default form to "Employee Pay Calculator"  and adding controls such as labels, textboxes, and buttons. The application's functionality is centered around three buttons: "Close," which exits the form; "Clear," which resets input fields; and "Calculate Pay," which computes gross pay, state and federal income tax deductions, FICA deductions, and net pay based on user-provided hourly rate and hours worked. The calculated values are displayed on the form, making it a simple yet functional payroll calculator for employees.
